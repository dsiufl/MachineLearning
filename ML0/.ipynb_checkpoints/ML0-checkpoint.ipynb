    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that relies on the idea that machines and learn from data. It invokes a process that is used to identify different patterns in given data and make decisions without human intervention. Machine Learning has a number of applications in the field of data science including image processing, classification, language processing, and learning association. \n",

During training, the model will essentially start to recognize patterns from the data it is given and then is able to make the decisions you have designed it to make. "

    "### Step 1 : Data Cleaning and Formatting\n",
    "The first step will always be data cleaning. One of the problems with machine learning is that the data fed into the models should be pristine. Most models will result in errors if there is something wrong with data types or formatting. A good idea is to outline how you want your data to be formatted and then clean the data you get to those specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 : Exporatory Data Analysis \n",
    "Once your data is clean, spend some time analyzing what you have. Look to see if you can decipher some patterns and relationships yourself. Use visualizations to aid in this process. Try to make statistical observations. For example: contructing linear models to determine relationships between different features. Regression is after all a subset of Machine Learning. EDA is extrmemely important in because first you have to be able to detmine a purpose for you model before you design one. In order to do this you have to know your data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3 : Design/Choose\n",
    "After you have a plan of what purpose you want your ML model to serve, you then have to choose/implement the model. This is a tricky process as there is a lot that goes into this step.\n",
    "#### Step 3.1 : Three Main Branches of Machine Learning\n",
    "Before we start choosing a model to use, we have to first find out what type of problem we are solving. Almost all problems will fall under one of the three categories of machine learning:\n",
    "##### - Supervised Learning\n",
    "The goal of supervised learning to determine a function. As a review of the basics, functions have inputs and outputs. Supervised learning uses data to come up with a function that fits the data. That way a prediction can be made when the model is introducted to a new data point. This type of machine learning requires that the data have inputs and sample outputs for each data point to use to train the model. This is the most popular method of learning used by data scientists to implement in the field.\n",
    "##### - Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "The goal of unsupervised learning is determine hidden patterns in the data from unlabeled data (data with just input points and no outputs). Its is mainly used for processes like anomaly detection ot data pre-processing. It is also used to sometimes pre-train data and provide outputs values that can then be used in supervised learning models (semi-supervised learning) \n",
    "##### - Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "This method trains machine learning models to make make series of decisions. It uses trial and terror to come up with solutions to problems and react to the environment they run in. Although not used a lot in mainstream industry there are still a lot of application such as in Game AI.<br><br>\n",
    "<img src='branches_ml.png' width='600' align='center'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3.2 : Data - Features and Targets\n",
    "The data we use in ML can split into features and targets. While mostly used in supervised learning it is key to training most ML models. Features are all the data collected for each data point and the target is what you want to be able to predict about each data point.<br><br> For example: If we want to make a machine learning model that can determine whether or not a pokemon is legendary or not, we would have data such as the following: "

    "Neural networks are one of the most popular models used in Machine Learning and in Deep Learning. They are meant to imitate the way we think, and are designed after the neurons in our brain. The way we learn is through a series of observations (features?) and eventually after enought observeations we can determine facts (labels?). While we are learning we process these observations, looking at different scenarious in a method similar to trial and error in order to figure out what the final fact is. Neural networks work the same way. <br><br> This is the general structure of a deep neural network:\n",

    "<b>Overview:</b>\n",
    "An observation (feature) is put in through the input layer. At each layer the nodes have a different activation function which is applied to the values from the previous layer. (Note: This is similar to neurons firing at thier synapses before passing them onto the next neuron) Before reaching each node (flowing though the neuron) the values are weighted. During training, the input flows through the network being weighted and activated at each layer before finally getting a predicted output. After going through the network, the model evaluates the output and compare it with the target value. It then backpropogrates though the network and changes the weights in hopes that it will now reach the right target value.\n",

    "<b>Backpropagation:</b> This is the process of going back through the network and changing the weights between layers. That way when the new data is fed though the network, it will be closer to reaching the desired output.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>Batch Size:</b> The back size is the amount of data points that are fed through the network before backpropogation happens. This allows the model to collect enough data about the models performance so that it can adjust the weight accordingly.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>Epoch:</b> An epoch is when all the data is put thought the suring training and the weights have been adjusted accordingly. Even though by the end of epoch, the all the data has been used, it will take mulitple epochs in order to fully train the model with good accuracy. In each epoch, the whole process including backpropogation after each batch is repeated.\n",
